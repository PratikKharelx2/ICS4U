Basic Overview:
The purpose of this code is to create an interactive program that combines several different technologies to provide a unique user experience. 
The program uses computer vision techniques, such as hand and face detection, to analyze the video feed from the user's webcam and provide visual feedback. 
It also uses speech recognition and text-to-speech conversion to allow the user to interact with the program using their voice. 
One of the things that I have done is: designing the program to be modular, with different functions handling different tasks. 
For example, the `hand_detection` function uses the OpenCV and mediapipe libraries to detect hands in a given frame of video, while the `listen` function uses the speech_recognition and pyttsx3 libraries to listen for audio input and generate a spoken response.
This modular design makes it easier for the code writer to maintain and update the code, as well as add new features in the future. 
Overall, my goal is to create a program that is both functional and engaging, providing users with a unique way to interact with their computer using both visual and audio input. 
By combining several different technologies, I have tried to create a program that is both sophisticated and user-friendly.

Usage of this code for Personal Usage:
