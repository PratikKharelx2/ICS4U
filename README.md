Basic Overview:
The purpose of this code is to create an interactive program that combines several different technologies to provide a unique user experience. 
The program uses computer vision techniques, such as hand detection and sign language recognition, to analyze the video feed from the user's webcam and provide a textual response and feedback. 
One of the things that I have done is: designing the program to be modular, with different functions handling different tasks. 
For example, the `hand_tracking` function uses the OpenCV and mediapipe libraries to detect hands in a given frame of video and trace landmarks on it, while the  resp function in response_generator.py uses the OpenAI libraries to understand the user's sign-language inputs and generate a printed response.
This modular design makes it easier for the code writer to maintain and update the code, as well as add new features in the future. 
Overall, my goal is to create a program that is both functional and engaging, providing users with a unique way to interact with their computer using both visual sign langauge input. 
By combining several different technologies, I have tried to create a program that is both sophisticated and user-friendly.

Usage of this code for Personal Usage:
Anyone is free to use this code however they like.
If you want to or feel the need to, go ahead and credit me.
Otherwise, there is no need to do anything from your part;
just go on and take the code. :)
